# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Project Overview:

<b>

The upper management of a company named `AutosRUs` has approached their new employee `Jeremy` about a special project. The companies newest car prototype they call `MechaCar` is suffering from production troubles that are prohibiting the manufacturing teams's progress. We will help Jeremy and the data analytics team review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team. In this challenge, we will do the following below:

<br>

1. Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
2. Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
3. Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
4. Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.
